Those insisting there s still apartheid in South Africa have always made reference to Orania. The town in Northern Cape province is exclusively inhabited by white Afrikaners since it was established in 1991.Often described as South Africa s Whites-only town, Orania is already using a local currency called Ora. The local currency is printed by the town s chamber of commerce and distributed through its central bank.Now, the Northern Cape town is set to launch a digital version of the Ora and, the Congress of South Africa s Trade Unions (COSATU) isn t cool with the development.From our gatherings, the Orania s digital currency will be accessed through an app which will enable users to buy the digital currency from the central bank, and use them for transactions.The coordinator of the Orania s digital currency, Peter Krige told CNN that e-Ora is basically, an electronic cash that will be moved from wallet to wallet with every transaction without the commercial banks standing in the middle. This way, friction and cost are removed from the transaction. Both consumers and retailers will save between three and five percent per transaction, Krige added.However, COSATU maintained that the real intent behind Orania s digital currency is to escalate the independence of the town from South Africa.COSATU s Gosalamang Jantjies described the move for Orania s digital currency as a slap in the face of the government of South Africa.Jantjies said COSATU is pissed by the intensifying racism in Orania which is actively undermining the democratically elected government of South Africa.Having said that, Jantjies urged South Africans in Northern Cape to start making plans which will bring about the transformation of Orania.He said South Africans can t be held hostage by a bunch of hypocrites who want to selectively exclude themselves from the broader society while they use South African markets to sell their produce. If they want to exclude themselves from the broader South African population they must be made to pay heavily for their use of the land s infrastructure, he added.Jantjies further contended thus: Their portrayal of Orania as a country instead of a town in South Africa and their resistance to be incorporated into Thembelihle Municipality is a clear indication that the residents of Orania do not belong to this beautiful Province, let alone the country.These very same people use the rail and roads of our Province and country to transport their farm produce as well as their goods and families. With the above, Jantjies announced that COSATU believes it s time for the government to act with agility against Orania.The government must ensure that these untransformed Afrikaner offsprings are incorporated into our society and abide by the laws of the country, he said.
