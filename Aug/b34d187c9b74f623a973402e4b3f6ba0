We ve all been there you meet someone for the first time and that moment they realise you re South African, they suddenly start spouting random comments on your ethnicity, childhood, experiences or just ask the most annoying questions ever.Seriously people. We come from a country where the geographical location is pretty much spelled out for you. It s the SOUTH part of AFRICA. SOUTH AFRICA. Get it??Apparently many, many people truly believe that only black people can be African. Never mind the fact that migration these days mean anyone of any race can be born and live pretty much anywhere.Yes, we have white South Africans, Indian South Africans, coloured South Africans, black South Africans, Asian South Africans, Latino South Africans we re a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities and if you don t know at least that about our awesome country by now, there s no helping you!Yes sure bru, because we speak Souf Efrican. No. Just no. We have 11 official languages but South African is not one of them.Of course! We all live in the bush, have pet lions and warthogs and we ride our zebras to school. Only rich people get to ride elephants to school because they cost so much money to maintain. We also have never heard of cars and clearly rode our zebras all the way to London/New York/Sydney dreaming of a life with electricity and running water and wifi! Oh John! Yeah he and I grew up on the same street! How do you know John? Come on people, we have a population of over 50 million people, you really think we re going to know every other South African in the world? Bonus points if they add he s from Africa !
