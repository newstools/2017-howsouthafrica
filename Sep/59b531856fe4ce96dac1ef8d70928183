A R674m Sandton public transport loop, which apparently created 260 000 employment opportunities, was launched by City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba at the Sandton Gautrain station on Tuesday.Mashaba said the loop &#8211; which the city will pilot from September 18 and until December &#8211; will provide efficient movement around Sandton. It will run along Rivonia Road, Fredman Drive, and Fifth Street among others.Mashaba explained that the project was inherited from the previous administration, but that due to that administration&#8217;s decade-long neglect of infrastructure maintenance in the city, more work had to be done.&#8220;This upgrade is intended to ease traffic congestion, it&#8217;s intended to link Sandton to the community of Alex, and improve access to transport systems with reduced travel times thereby accelerating our city&#8217;s economic growth,&#8221; he said.For more than two years the city has been working on improving pedestrian space in the form of sidewalks, more cycle lanes, upgrading infrastructure around traffic signalisation and building two bridges over the M1 freeway &#8211; one for pedestrians and one for the Rea Vaya bus service &#8211; to link Alexandra township and Sandton.During the pilot period, the city will welcome public feedback on whether the project is meeting its intended objective or not.Watch video:
