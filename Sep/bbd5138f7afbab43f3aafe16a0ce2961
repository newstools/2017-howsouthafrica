In the wake of talking for quite a while, the pair went out on the town and have been as one from that point onward.Somizi did not uncover his man&#8217;s name but rather said that he was not in media outlets.On a recent episode of his reality show, Living the Dream with Somizi, the radio personality claimed that he was a &#8220;freelancer&#8221; in the love department and outlined his ideal man.&#8220;He needs to have money. He has a job. He has a career. He has a house. He has everything. Until I found someone who is on my level, I&#8217;m not committing. I&#8217;ll freelance. I&#8217;ll be Mr. delivery,&#8221; he said.The star told True Love that he finally found what he was looking for.
