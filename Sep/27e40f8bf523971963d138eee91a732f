South Africa s President Jacob Zuma has blamed witchcraft for his party s failure to beat the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) in its Western Cape.According to Soweto Live reports, he was quoted saying ghosts might even been voting to keep the DA in power, during the speech made in both isiZulu and isiXhosa languages.He said; In the last elections I was satisfied that we were taking the Western Cape I even said so. What went wrong? I too can t tell you. I don t know [maybe] it s because of witchcraft, witches practice their craft in different ways, I don t know where they get the luck to win here because people in the majority are not living comfortably. Maybe even ghosts are voting. The Sowetan Live also quotes Mr Zuma as saying that witches even use electricity these days.He made the comments yesterday while addressing fellow party members at Lwandle Hall in the south-western town of Strand, a year after his governing ANC party suffered crushing defeats in local elections.
