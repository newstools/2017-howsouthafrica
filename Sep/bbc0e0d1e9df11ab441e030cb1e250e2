Fresh protests started in the area this week, where businesses and schools have been closed since Monday just because Government has failed to reach compromise with the Vuwani residents over the shutdown of limpopo town,Despite the regional municipal offices and traffic department being re-opened, residents insist they dont want the new municipality collecting revenue from those facilities.Government spokesman Phuti Seloba says provincial departments, the Vhembe District Municipality and the LIM345 council will be providing services to the area and Vuwani residents need to accept this. There s no dispute that the responsibility to service this area belongs to LIM345. But protest leader Nsovo Sambo says it s a slap in the face to residents who ve made it clear they don&#8217;t want the LIM345 council to render any services in the town.

He says the shutdown will remain in place until government revokes powers from that new municipal entity.WATCH: Vuwani maintains hope, resistance WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN LIM345 Vuwani residents say they don t understand why the Limpopo government is trying to force them to accept services from a municipality they have no interest in.In May, President Jacob Zuma announced that the area should be serviced by the Vhembe District Municipality as residents refuse to fall under the new LIM345 council.But the Limpopo government says it s not possible to follow through on the president s announcement.Last year, residents embarked on a month-long protest which left 30 schools burnt or vandalised.Chief among their demands was to be reverted to Makhado, their old municipality.President Zuma intervened this year and pronounced that the area will be serviced by the Vhembe District Municipality, a decision residents approved.However, Limpopo government says that s not possible.Seloba says: We never wanted to embarrass the president, we never wanted to embark on a malicious compliance.
