The City of Tshwane has propelled a bike unit to help battle wrongdoing in the nation&#8217;s capital city.The unit is a consequence of an organization that started a year prior between the city and the Hatfield City Improvement District (CID).The CID is a non-benefit association made up of properties in the range. Bikes were financed by the business group inside CID. The unit is a piece of the Tshwane Metro Police Department.Tshwane leader Solly Msimanga said the unit will begin with only 20 officers who volunteered to join and is relied upon to be extended to different parts of Tshwane including the downtown area.. We have been able to launch in Hatfield because the business community saw the need to partner with us and sponsor us with bicycles. If we can get that in the CBD Centurion Mamelodi Garankuwa Hamanskraal we should be able to launch as soon as possible in other spaces. Msimanga said the student community had raised concerns about being constantly mugged in Hatfield and this unit would deal with such crimes.The bicycles also communicate with CCTV camera monitors who will give the officers information about any crime taking place in a particular spot. You have a better chance of manoeuvering through traffic and pavement with a bicycle than a car. Also when you have these guys visible on the streets visibility also reduces the likelihood of people getting mugged he said.The unit is part of Msimanga s plan to improve safety in the city and attract investment.The city has already launched a drug unit and is expected to soon launch one to deal with hijackings.
