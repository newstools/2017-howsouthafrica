Caster Semenya was under tough criticism from controversial British media personality Katie Hopkins in the build-up to her 800m final on Sunday night.Hopkins had caused a storm on Twitter with a series of posts that suggested that it was not fair for Semenya, who has higher levels of testosterone than most women, to compete.South African twitter users responded to Hopkins on Saturday defending Semenya, and when the 26-year-old won gold in Sunday&#8217;s 800m final at the World Athletics Championships, she received messages of support from all corners.It means that Semenya leaves London with two medals after also having won bronze in the women&#8217;s 1 500m final.Semenya seems used to dealing with the likes of Hopkins, and she posted a powerful me ssage on Twitter on Saturday that seemed to be her response to what was going on.&#8220;You may not be able to control every situation and its outcome, but you can control your attitude and how you deal with it,&#8221; Semenya&#8217;s post read.Twitter responds to Caster Semenya gold:Champions are born, not made, you truly are one @caster800m&mdash; Temba Bavuma (@tbavuma10) August 13, 2017Just landed in Dubai to hear @caster800m has won GOLD!
