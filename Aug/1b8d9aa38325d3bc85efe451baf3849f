Other ways of contracting hepatitis B include:The risk of spread is increased when there are higher levels of virus in the blood. The level of virus varies considerably between people infected with hepatitis B.(usually less than 6 months)About 50% of adults and 90% of children do not develop any symptoms at the time of infection.Symptoms, if they occur, may include:Acute infection may be followed by chronic infection. People unable to eliminate the hepatitis B virus from their body following an acute infection and who remain infected for more than 6 months are said to have chronic hepatitis B infection.Both acute and chronic hepatitis B infections are diagnosed by blood tests serology and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests in a pathology laboratory.If liver inflammation continues, a needle may be inserted into the liver to obtain a sample of liver for further testing.(time between becoming infected and developing symptoms)Between 45 to 180 days, and rarely from as early as 2 weeks to as late as 9 months.(time during which an infected person can infect others)From up to 3 months before symptoms develop until the infected person eliminates the virus from their body. Chronically infected people remain infectious for life although the risk of transmitting the infection to others varies considerably from person-to-person.Antiviral treatment is available and is of benefit to some people with chronic hepatitis B infection.People with hepatitis B virus infection but no symptoms were once thought to be &#8216;healthy carriers&#8217;. However, all people with chronic hepatitis B should receive regular, lifelong monitoring of disease progression by a general practitioner or liver specialist .Routine monitoring (at least annually) even when there are no symptoms, can prevent severe liver disease including liver cancer.There is a safe and effective vaccine available for hepatitis B for infants and those at higher risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection and/or higher risk of severe disease. Completion of a full course will give protection against hepatitis B infection in more than 90% of people. Loading...
