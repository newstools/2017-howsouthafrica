To direct that the speaker has the discretion to decide on whether the motion of no confidence should be voted on by a show of hands or by secret ballot.To give room for a replay of what happened in Mogale City, where the then-DA mayor, Michael Holenstein, was removed by secret ballot.To set aside the decision that a vote for a new executive mayor and new speaker may not be voted on immediately after the motion has taken place.To order that any of the respondents who oppose the application bear the cost jointly and severally.
