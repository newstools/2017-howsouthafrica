Though Kim Kardashian is standing by Kanye West in the midst of all his scandals, beefs, and rants, it doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;s doing it out of love. Despite their cute Instas and photo ops, the rumor mill suggests there is plenty of discord in Kimye&#8217;s marriage.Let&#8217;s break it down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#8217;re materialists&#8230;and he&#8217;s &#8216;broke&#8217;In February 2016, West took to Twitter (via Billboard) to moan and groan about his financial woes. &#8220;I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt Please pray we overcome This is my true heart,&#8221; he tweeted.Of course, those figures aren&#8217;t quite accurate. West&#8217;s net worth is actually about $160 million on his own, while Kardashian adds a cool $175 million to their collective total. Talk about 1 percent problems!Kanye is controllingRemember when West threw out all of Kardashian&#8217;s clothes on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, just to replace them with things he&#8217;d picked out himself? That was just the beginning. From her occasional blonde hair to her increasingly dramatic use of cosmetics (and alleged cosmetic surgeries), Kardashian seems to have shed any shred of her pre-West identity.Talk show host Wendy Williams told Radar Online, &#8220;I think that she likes the illusion of having a husband and children. He likes her because he likes a nice Barbie Doll. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a real marriage. I believe that she&#8217;s more like a muse and he&#8217;s molding and creating her, so they work well together.&#8221;Sources also told Radar Online that West&#8217;s influence over Kardashian goes beyond the superficial, claiming the rapper tries to control her every move. &#8220;Kim is feeling totally smothered by Kanye right now,&#8221; an insider said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like she no longer has a voice Kim is kind of becoming his puppet and it seems she does not like it. But she almost asked for this, because in some ways this is all that she ever wanted.&#8221;Kanye may be unfaithfulEx-girlfriend Rose has come out time and again saying that her relationship with West ended because he was cheating on her with Kardashian. As the old adage goes, &#8220;If they&#8217;ll do it with you, they&#8217;ll do it to you.&#8221;There&#8217;s speculation that West&#8217;s eye is wandering again, at least if his phone records are any indication. The New York Daily News reported that porn star Lisa Ann (of, er, Nailin&#8217; Palin fame) claims to have a slew of nude photos sent to her from West during his marriage to Kardashian.Kim&#8217;s robbery put a strain on the marriageSome insiders say Kimye&#8217;s marriage hasn&#8217;t been the same since Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint inside her hotel room in Paris in October 2016. A source told Page Six, &#8220;[They] have been arguing a lot since the Paris robbery. Kim has completely calmed down her life, but Kanye is stubbornly refusing to let fear get in the way of what he wants to do.&#8221;A source concurred to People, &#8220;Kim has had a very rough time since the robbery. It hasn&#8217;t helped that Kanye has been touring. Their lives have been quite chaotic. It&#8217;s been very trying for them both and not a good recipe for a happy marriage.&#8221; The source continued, &#8220;Kim [was] usually the more stable and strong person in the marriage [before the robbery]. Kanye is used to leaning on her. Since Kim has had her own issues to deal with, the roles have been reversed. Kanye has had to stay strong to support Kim, and it&#8217;s like he can&#8217;t handle it anymore. It&#8217;s like Kanye is falling apart now, because Kim hasn&#8217;t been able to give him her full attention.&#8221;Kanye&#8217;s breakdown hurt their unionWest&#8217;s November 2016 breakdown was spawned by a lot of potential challenges: mental illness, exhaustion, paranoia, the anniversary of his mother&#8217;s death, and, reportedly, marital strife. That strife didn&#8217;t really get better once he was out of the hospital. A source told Us Weekly that Kardashian and West were living apart while he recovered, adding, &#8220;Kim is being very protective and doesn&#8217;t want Kanye around the kids right now it&#8217;s a valid concern.&#8221;Kanye has anger issuesIf you need proof beyond his November 2016 breakdown that West has some sort of issue, look no further than his meltdown when performing on Saturday Night Live in February of the same year. The rapper went on a huge tirade when he discovered that Lorne Michaels&#8217; crew had the nerve to rearrange his staging for the show, and it was all recorded on audio obtained by Page Six.&#8220;Look at that s**t they took my f**king stage off&#8217;a SNL without asking me,&#8221; he gripes on the recording. &#8220;I am bummed If I am going to do this, we are breaking the motherf**king Internet.&#8221; In the same audio recording, he calls Taylor Swift a &#8220;fake a**&#8221; and compares himself to Stanley Kubrick, Pablo Escobar, and the apostle Paul. Seriously.A source told Life &amp; Style that Kimye has pursued couples&#8217; therapy in an effort to salvage the marriage. &#8220;Their therapist comes to their home and talks with them,&#8221; the insider said. &#8220;They were considering divorce, but decided to try to work it out. It&#8217;s been an uphill battle, but they&#8217;ve come a long way. They&#8217;re learning how to communicate and understand each other. They have learned to get along again. The therapy is helping, for now They discuss his different triggers and how Kim can keep him from getting upset at home.&#8221;He lashes out at her loved onesKardashian was reportedly furious when West referenced her sex tape in the song &#8220;Highlights,&#8221; but she may be even more upset about all the smack he talks about her loved ones.He rapped about Blac Chyna helping Rob Kardashian lose weight through what the Daily Mail referred to as &#8220;sexercise,&#8221; and he reportedly made the Jenners furious when he went on a rant against Kylie Jenner&#8217;s endorsement deal with Puma. West tweeted, &#8220;1000% there will never be a Kylie Puma anything. That&#8217;s on my family! 1000% Kylie is on Yeezy team!!! Puma we gone give you your measly million dollars back!!! Never try to divide the family!!!&#8221; Of course, that didn&#8217;t work out the way Yeezy planned.&nbsp;They were rich, but homelessKardashian and West are overflowing with cash, yet they lived with her mom, Kris Jenner, because they kept bickering over where to hang their designer hats.In 2013, the couple reportedly spent $11 million on a 10,000 square foot Bel-Air mansion, then gutted the property and built a 14,000 square foot home in its place. TMZ reported that the home housed a lot of animosities because Kardashian allegedly bankrolled the project while &#8220;Kanye couldn&#8217;t make up his mind.&#8221; According to People, the couple never even settled in there before putting it on the market for $20 million in 2015.At long last, the Daily Mail reported that the Wests were scheduled to move to their new palatial pad, boasting eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and 20,000 square feet, in May 2017.
