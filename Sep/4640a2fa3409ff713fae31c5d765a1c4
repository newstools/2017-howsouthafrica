Highly Reverent Archbishop Desmond Tutu rebuked Aung San Suu Kyi over the Myanmar government&#8217;s treatment of its Rohingya Muslims and asked her to intercede in the emergency.The United Nations on Thursday said that almost 164,000 Rohingya have gotten away to Bangladesh in the course of recent weeks in the wake of an enormous security concerns and affirmed abominations by the nation&#8217;s security powers and Buddhist hordes against the Rohingya.Suu Kyi, feted for her times of tranquil restriction to Myanmar&#8217;s junta rulers, has been encouraged to stand up for the Rohingya, with Muslim countries and the UN driving judgment of her administration.Tutu, who disassembled politically-sanctioned racial segregation in South Africa and turned into the ethical voice of the country, participated in the judgment. If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep, Tutu said in a statement. It is incongruous for a symbol of righteousness to lead such a country; it is adding to our pain, he said noting that the images we are seeing of the suffering of the Rohingya fill us with pain and dread. As we witness the unfolding horror we pray for you to be courageous and resilient again&#8230; for you to speak out for justice, human rights and the unity of your people, said Tutu.Witnesses in Myanmar s Rakhine state say entire villages have been burned to the ground since Rohingya militants launched a series of coordinated attacks on August 25, prompting a military-led crackdown.
