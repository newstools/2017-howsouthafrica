&nbsp; Not many people are aware of this disease, it can go undiagnosed in children and therefore I believe that a greater awareness around the condition must be created, explains Bhikha.Bhikha released his latest album, The Passing Traveller, and one of the songs titled Ca C est La Vie, (This is Life) is dedicated to six-year-old Humayra Bhodania living with this disease. Unlike other children her age she walks around with an oxygen tank by her side, connected through her nose yet she is positive, happy and adamant to live each day to its fullest. Humayra, like any other girl her age loves to play dress up, spend time with her family and friends, enjoy the outdoors. However some of these things do not come as easy for her due to her condition. A PHT campaign was thus necessary in order to educate her community about her disease. Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of your heart. The disease begins when tiny arteries in your lungs, called pulmonary arteries, and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed. This makes it harder for blood to flow through your lungs, and raises pressure within your lungs arteries. As the pressure builds, your heart s lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs, eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and eventually fail.Pulmonary hypertension is a serious illness that becomes progressively worse and is sometimes fatal. Humayra s story teaches us to endure, to face challenges, to love selflessly and find the strength we all have within, adds Bhikha, Sometimes superheroes live in the hearts of little children fighting big battles. Little children who show us the meaning of unconditional love. Ca C est La Vie This is Life.To listen to the song featuring Humayra visit:
